# About me
Hello! While I publish/present under J. M. L. Whittington, you may call me Justin (he/they). I was born and raised in West Virginia, only recently moving to Orlando, Florida to enter the [Texts and Technology PhD program ](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/) at University of Central Florida as a student.

Here, I also serve as Graduate Research Associate with the [Center for Humanities and Digital Research](https://chdr.cah.ucf.edu/), as well as a Graduate Teaching Assistant - Grader for the [Games and Interactive Media Program](https://communication.ucf.edu/games-and-interactive-media/).

Lastly, I'm attached as a Research Assistant to a [John Deaver Drinko Academy Fellowship](https://www.marshall.edu/drinko/) project awarded to Dr. Luke Eric Lassiter of the [Graduate Humanities Program](https://www.marshall.edu/graduatehumanities/) at Marshall University, which I joined during my Master of Arts in Humanities at the same institution. You can see the team pictured below convening a roundtable at the 2024 Appalachian Studies Conference, at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina:
