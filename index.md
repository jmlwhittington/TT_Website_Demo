# About me
Hello! While I publish/present under J. M. L. Whittington, you may call me Justin (he/they). I was born and raised in West Virginia, only recently moving to Orlando, Florida to enter the [Texts and Technology PhD program ](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/) at University of Central Florida as a student.

Here, I also serve as Graduate Research Associate with the [Center for Humanities and Digital Research](https://chdr.cah.ucf.edu/), as well as a Graduate Teaching Assistant - Grader for the [Games and Interactive Media Program](https://communication.ucf.edu/games-and-interactive-media/).

Elsewhere, I'm attached as a Research Assistant to a [John Deaver Drinko Academy Fellowship](https://www.marshall.edu/drinko/) project awarded to Dr. Luke Eric Lassiter of the [Graduate Humanities Program](https://www.marshall.edu/graduatehumanities/) at Marshall University, which I joined during my Master of Arts in Humanities at the same institution. You can see the team pictured below convening a roundtable at the 2024 Appalachian Studies Conference, at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina:

My work has been featured at (inter)national conferences, including the [Digital Games Research Association](https://digra.org/), [Popular Culture Association](https://pcaaca.org/default.aspx), and [Appalachian Studies Association](https://www.appalachianstudies.org/). I've additionally had my hand over the years in music, game design/development, programming, homelabbing, and language/linguistics, at both professional and hobbyist levels across the board.

# Research interests
The blurb I usually give is "sociopolitical phenomena of games and theme parks." Breaking that down more specifically:

In games (video and tabletop):
- Intersections of games with international relations/postcolonialism
- [Appalachian game studies](https://groups.google.com/g/appalachian-game-studies)

In theme parks:
- (Dis)ability and other bodily variation in the theme park
- Transgression in the theme park
- Theme parks as medium, theming as [culturonics](https://filosofia.dickinson.edu/encyclopedia/culturonics/)

A further interest of mine is in [middle-state publishing, feed-forward scholarship](https://www.firstpersonscholar.com/feed-forward-scholarship/), and public (digital) humanities.
